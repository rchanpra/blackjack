# Blackjack

## Introduction

Welcome to Blackjack, a classical playing card game that is the most widely played casino banking game. The objective 
of the game is to win obtain the highest balance possible by obtaining a blackjack or creating a hand that is higher in 
value than the dealer's hand, but not exceeding 21. The dealer will be an AI that acts exactly the same as a casino 
dealer, in which the dealer will draw until the dealer's hand is at least 17 in value.

## Blackjack Ruling
- Decisions are hit, stand, and double down.
- Blackjack is the strongest, followed by 5-card Charlie, and then normal hand.
- Winnings are 2 times the bet.

## How to Play
1. Bet
2. Inspect cards dealt and make decisions
3. Wait for the dealer's turn
4. Repeat until broke or satisfy

## Targeted Users

The game application is designed for individuals who need a small break and are in the mood for a lighthearted game
session. The game is not too serious but those who wants to be a more competitive can easily do so by trying to obtain 
the highest balance possible.

## My Interest in this Project

This project is important to me as a developer because playing card games have always been nostalgic to me. They are the
perfect activities to get closer to friends and family. I was exposed to a lot of playing card games as a kid and as a 
result, I am rather passionate about it. Therefore, this project could also be considered a passion work.
