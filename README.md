# Snake

## Introduction

Welcome to Snake, a classic 2D arcade game where the player controls a snake to eat food and grow in length. The goal is
to collect as much as food possible while avoid running into the walls or the snake's own tail. When a piece of food is
collected, the score increases and the snake speeds up. This game application will have options for players to customize
their game, such as changing the theme, the color of the snake, the speed, etc. Their history of past games will also be
recorded and displayed, as well as the top score.

## How to Play
1. Use arrow keys or WASD to control the snake movement
2. Eat food to grow the snake and increment the score
3. Avoid running into the walls or the snake's tail
4. The game is over when the snake crashes into a wall or its own tail

## Targeted Users

The game application is designed for individuals who need a small break and are in the mood for a lighthearted game
session. The game is not too serious but those who wants to be a more competitive can easily do so by trying to obtain
the top score.

## My Interest in this Project

This project is important to me as a developer because classic arcade game has always been nostalgic to me. It is a
genre of games that is short and simple yet fascinating and competitive at times. It has a special place in my heart. I 
would also like to create a game application that has an ui interface, something that is uncommon in what we have done
in CPSC110.
